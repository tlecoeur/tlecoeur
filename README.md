# 👋 Hi, I'm Thomas Lecoeur

💻 Full Stack Developer & Senior Product Manager — blending code and product to build things that actually work.  
🔁 I didn't leave compliance & fraud — I leveled it up with full stack development skills.  
🚀 Bootcamp grad @ La Capsule (2025), now crafting full stack apps with speed and joy.  
📍 Paris-based, terminal always open, curious mind always on.

## ⚙️ Tech I'm working with

`JavaScript` · `React` · `React Native` , `REST API` · `Node.js` · `Express` · `MongoDB` · `Vercel`  
Always happy to add a new tool to the stack if it gets the job done.

## 🧠 Previously

10+ years designing and managing B2B products in the finance and compliance space —  
leading teams, solving fraud, navigating audits, and translating chaos into clean features.
